# Agricultural Weather Warning System

A privacy-protected agricultural weather monitoring platform built with Zama FHEVM technology, providing confidential weather services for farmers while maintaining complete data privacy through Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).

## üåæ Overview

The Agricultural Weather Warning System is a decentralized application that enables farmers to monitor weather conditions, receive automated alerts, and protect sensitive agricultural data through advanced cryptographic techniques. By leveraging Zama's FHEVM technology, all sensitive information remains encrypted even during computation, ensuring unprecedented privacy for agricultural operations.

## üîê Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
This platform utilizes Zama's FHEVM technology to perform computations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. This means:
- Crop types remain confidential
- Farm sizes stay private
- Weather measurements are encrypted
- Alert thresholds are processed without exposing raw data
- Only authorized parties can decrypt specific information

### Confidential Agricultural Weather Intelligence
Traditional weather monitoring systems expose sensitive farm data, potentially revealing business strategies, crop choices, and operational details. Our FHE-powered solution ensures:
- **Data Privacy**: All agricultural metrics are encrypted end-to-end
- **Competitive Advantage**: Farm information cannot be accessed by competitors
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets strict data protection requirements
- **Trustless Computation**: Smart contracts process encrypted data autonomously

### Privacy-Preserving Weather Services
The system provides real-time weather monitoring and alerting while maintaining complete confidentiality:
- Encrypted weather data submission
- Private threshold configuration
- Confidential alert generation
- Anonymous farm registration

## üìä Features

- **Encrypted Farm Registration**: Register farms with confidential crop types and size parameters
- **Private Weather Data Submission**: Submit temperature, humidity, wind speed, soil moisture, and rainfall data with FHE encryption
- **Customizable Alert Thresholds**: Configure personalized warning parameters for different weather conditions
- **Automated Alert System**: Receive real-time notifications when weather conditions exceed safe thresholds
- **Privacy-First Dashboard**: Monitor system status without exposing sensitive information
- **Blockchain Transparency**: Verifiable operations with encrypted data integrity

## üéØ Smart Contract Functions

### Farm Management
- `registerFarm()`: Register a new farm with encrypted parameters (crop type, farm size, thresholds)
- `getFarmInfo()`: Retrieve public farm information (registration status, timestamps)

### Weather Data Operations
- `submitWeatherData()`: Submit encrypted weather measurements (temperature, humidity, wind, soil moisture, rainfall)
- `getWeatherDataTimestamp()`: Query data submission timestamps

### Alert Management
- `updateThresholds()`: Modify warning threshold values for weather parameters
- `getAlertTimestamp()`: Check alert status and timing
- `resolveAlerts()`: Clear active weather alerts

### System Statistics
- `getSystemStats()`: Retrieve overall system metrics (total farms, alert count, last update)
- `getTotalFarms()`: Query registered farm count

## üöÄ Usage Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect Wallet" to link your MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
2. **Register Farm**: Enter farm details including name, crop type, and size (encrypted automatically)
3. **Configure Thresholds**: Set personalized warning thresholds for temperature, humidity, wind, moisture, and rainfall
4. **Submit Weather Data**: Input current weather measurements from your farm sensors or observations
5. **Monitor Alerts**: Check the alert dashboard for any active weather warnings
6. **Resolve Alerts**: Clear alerts once appropriate actions have been taken

### Weather Parameters

The system monitors five critical weather parameters:

- **Temperature**: High/low temperature alerts (¬∞C)
- **Humidity**: Excessive or insufficient humidity warnings (%)
- **Wind Speed**: Strong wind alerts (km/h)
- **Soil Moisture**: Drought monitoring (%)
- **Rainfall**: Flood risk assessment (mm)

## üîí Privacy Guarantees

### What Remains Encrypted
- Individual crop types and varieties
- Exact farm sizes and locations
- Specific weather measurements
- Custom threshold configurations
- Historical weather patterns

### What Is Public
- Total number of registered farms
- Aggregate alert statistics
- Transaction timestamps
- Contract deployment information

## üåü Use Cases
